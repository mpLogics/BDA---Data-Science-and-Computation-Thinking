Instructions for the running the code
The code can be easily run via Jupyter notebooks. 
There are some basic libraries that have been used particularly for data structures and plotting purposes (numpy, random, matplotlib).

Any .ipynb file, once opened in Jupyter:-
1. Run the cells in a sequential manner
2. You may view the outputs you want. 

All the outputs, methodology, approach, results, inferences, observation, analysis and takeaways have been 
written in the form of a report. It is for the ease of the reader. One can directly open the reports and 
see what has been implemented using the code.

Hope you have a great day!
