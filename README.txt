Steps to access and run the codes:
1. The codes are independent and can run individually.
2. There are 4 files, each with the name of the problem they provide a solution for.
3. These can be opened in the Jupyter Notebook or in Google Colab for easy view and run.
4. Individual files may or have some specific instructions to run the program.
5. The cells program has been written sequentially, except for Q2, where same variables have been used to store the distribution. One may run either to check the classifier.
6. For complete answer, kindly go through the entire notebook. The justification/theoretical discussion has been done in the form of text cells in the notebook.

Thank You.
